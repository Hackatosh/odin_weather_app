# odin_weather_app

Weather app implemented with JavaScript, HTML, CSS as part of the Odin Project curriculum. It allows the user to search a city and display the weather forecast using WeatherAPI.

DOM manipulations functions and functions dealing with the API have been separated in different modules.
Webpack is used to bundle modules. 

The "src" directory contains the source code and the "dist" directory contains the distibution code generated by webpack.
